# 4x4-Keypad-Interfacing-with-STM32F411VE-MCU
In this project, I have interfaced a 4x4 Keypad with STM32F411E discovery board. For interfacing, GPIO peripheral is used of the MCU for 8 I/O pins i.e. four input pins and four output pins. When the button is pressed on the keypad, it displays the output of the same.
